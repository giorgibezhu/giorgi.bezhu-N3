            <div class="number12"><p> It takes a strong philosopher to assume control of a preposition and propel it into a foreign language.
                 That is what Friedrich Nietzsche did with the word über.
                  In German, it can mean “over,” “beyond,” or “about.”
                   You are reading an essay über Nietzsche. As a prefix,
                    über is sometimes equivalent to the English “super”—übernatürlich is
                     “supernatural”—but it has less of an aggrandizing effect.
                      Nietzsche altered the destiny of the word when, in the eighteen-eighties,
                       he began speaking of the Übermensch, which has been translated as “superman,” “superhuman,”
                        and “overman.” Scholars still debate what Nietzsche had in mind.
                         A physically stronger being? A spiritual aristocrat?
                          A kind of cyborg? “Overperson” might be the most literal equivalent in English,
                           although it is unlikely that DC Comics would have sold many comic books using that title.</p></div>
